# Happy Wall API

express server for the happy wall app.

I used node.js, express because I have been using the MERN stack mostly on the past 3 years
and I could deliver this assignment quicker.

## Getting started

```
    git clone

    npm install

    npm start
```

Tests for the controllers can be run using Mocha,

```
    npm test
```
